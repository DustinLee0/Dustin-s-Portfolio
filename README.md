# Dustin-s-Portfolio  |  Full Stack Developer Student

Hello and welcome to my repository that contains the code for my portfolio. 

On this webpage you will find information about me, places I have worked, and contact information. In the navigation bar, you can click any category and it will take you to the corresponding section on the page. The first section shows a personal portrait of me with a quote said by Jordan Peterson.

The about me section will contain a small introduction to my life and also some lorem ipsum text. The work section has 3 cards placed in a grid. You can click any card to take you to the website/full picture. I will be adding more projects to this section as the course progresses.
